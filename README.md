There's is my personnal "optimization" for Firefox.

These project is based mostly from [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) and some assets are coming from [Narsil's project](https://codeberg.org/Narsil/user.js/src/branch/main/desktop).

It improve your privacy. Make your browser smoother for 120hz+ monitor. If you don't have these kind of monitor, you can see other option for "Smoothfox" in Betterfox's Repo.  

For more security, please, use [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/). Set "3rd party script" "3rd party frames" to be on "Medium Mode". It would break some site, you can downgrade the blocking to set "noop" on these 2 options.
